## KIS Project Memory

This project uses KIS memory under `kis/`. Knowledge = stable facts. Intent = goals and plans. State = current reality.

- Read `kis/state/` before planning or implementing, then only the Intent and Knowledge the task needs.
- Put each fact in exactly one layer, and update an existing file instead of creating a new one.
- Prove work with real command or verification output before marking anything done.
- Synchronize the KIS layers that changed when work finishes.
- Full instructions: `.agents/skills/kis/SKILL.md`.
- Commands live in `.agents/skills/kis/commands/`: start, plan, act, sync, check, init.
  Claude `/kis:start`, Pi and OpenCode `/kis-start`, Codex `/prompts:kis-start`.
  Antigravity has no custom slash commands: name the step and follow its command file.
